# FMEA Todo List Implementation Guide for Apigee X API Management

This implementation guide provides detailed instructions on how to set up and manage a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) Todo List system for Apigee X API Management. It expands on the structure outlined in the design document with practical implementation steps.

## Section 1: Setting Up Your FMEA Todo List System

### Step 1: Choose Your Tracking Tool

#### Option A: Spreadsheet Implementation
1. Create a new spreadsheet (Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, etc.)
2. Set up the following tabs:
   - **Instructions** - Documentation on how to use the system
   - **FMEA Register** - Main FMEA documentation with all failure modes
   - **Todo List** - Extracted tasks with status tracking
   - **Dashboard** - Summary of progress and key metrics
   - **Meeting Notes** - Documentation of FMEA sessions

3. In the FMEA Register tab, create columns for:
   ```
   | ID | Process/Function | Potential Failure Mode | Potential Effects | Is a New Risk? | Severity | Occurrence | Detection | RPN | Recommended Actions | Responsibility | Target Date | Status | Completion Date | New RPN |
   ```

4. In the Todo List tab, create columns for:
   ```
   | Task ID | Related FMEA ID | Task Description | Category | Priority | Assigned To | Status | Due Date | % Complete | Completion Date | Notes |
   ```

5. In the Dashboard tab, create:
   - Summary counts of tasks by priority
   - Summary counts of tasks by status
   - Charts showing progress over time
   - List of overdue tasks
   - List of upcoming deadlines

#### Option B: Project Management Tool Implementation
1. Select a project management tool (Jira, Asana, Trello, etc.)
2. Create a new project titled "Apigee X FMEA"
3. Set up the following custom fields:
   - FMEA ID (text)
   - Severity (number, 1-10)
   - Occurrence (number, 1-10)
   - Detection (number, 1-10)
   - RPN (calculated field if supported, or manual entry)
   - Is New Risk (yes/no)

4. Create the following task statuses:
   - Not Started
   - In Planning
   - In Progress
   - In Review
   - Completed
   - Deferred
   - Cancelled

5. Set up labels or tags for:
   - Priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Component categories (Authentication, Traffic Management, etc.)
   - Task types (Preventive, Detective, Mitigative)

6. Create dashboard views for:
   - Tasks by assignee
   - Tasks by priority
   - Tasks by status
   - Upcoming deadlines
   - Overdue tasks

### Step 2: Configure Automation (Optional)

For spreadsheet implementation:
1. Set up conditional formatting to highlight:
   - High RPN values in the FMEA Register
   - Overdue tasks in the Todo List
   - Tasks approaching deadlines

2. Create formulas to:
   - Calculate RPN automatically (Severity × Occurrence × Detection)
   - Count tasks by status and priority for the dashboard
   - Link tasks in the Todo List to their corresponding FMEA items

For project management tool implementation:
1. Set up automation rules for:
   - Notifications when tasks are assigned
   - Reminders for approaching deadlines
   - Status updates when subtasks are completed
   - Priority adjustments based on RPN values

2. Create workflow triggers for:
   - Automatic task creation when new FMEA items are added
   - Notifications to stakeholders when critical issues are identified
   - Regular status report generation

### Step 3: Define Access Controls and Permissions

1. Determine who needs access to the FMEA Todo List system:
   - FMEA team members (full edit access)
   - Team leads and managers (edit access to their areas)
   - Stakeholders (view access)
   - Executives (dashboard view access)

2. Set up appropriate permissions in your chosen tool

3. Create a process for requesting access and changes

## Section 2: Populating Your FMEA Todo List

### Step 1: Initial Task Creation

1. Start with the highest RPN items from your FMEA
2. For each item, break down the recommended actions into specific, actionable tasks
3. Assign each task a unique ID (e.g., T-001, T-002)
4. Link each task to its parent FMEA item
5. Assign priority based on the RPN and severity
6. Set realistic due dates based on priority and resource availability
7. Assign responsibility to specific individuals or teams

Example task breakdown for FMEA item API-006 (Inadequate key rotation):

```
Parent FMEA Item: API-006 (RPN: 392)
Tasks:
- T-001: Document current key management processes (Priority: High, Assigned: Security Analyst, Due: 2025-04-10)
- T-002: Design automated key rotation workflow (Priority: Critical, Assigned: Security Architect, Due: 2025-04-15)
- T-003: Implement key expiration mechanism in Apigee X (Priority: Critical, Assigned: API Developer, Due: 2025-04-18)
- T-004: Create monitoring for key usage patterns (Priority: High, Assigned: Operations Engineer, Due: 2025-04-20)
- T-005: Test automated rotation in development environment (Priority: Critical, Assigned: QA Engineer, Due: 2025-04-22)
- T-006: Update documentation and training materials (Priority: Medium, Assigned: Technical Writer, Due: 2025-04-25)
- T-007: Deploy to production environment (Priority: Critical, Assigned: DevOps Engineer, Due: 2025-04-28)
```

### Step 2: Task Categorization

Categorize tasks to facilitate filtering and reporting:

1. By component:
   - Authentication & Authorization

   - Process Improvement

3. By implementation approach:
   - Preventive (preventing failures)
   - Detective (improving detection)
   - Mitigative (reducing impact)

### Step 3: Dependency Mapping

1. Identify dependencies between tasks
2. Document these dependencies in your tracking system
3. Adjust due dates to account for dependencies
4. Create a visual dependency map for complex task sets

Example dependency notation:
```
T-003: Implement key expiration mechanism (Depends on: T-002)
T-005: Test automated rotation (Depends on: T-003)
T-007: Deploy to production (Depends on: T-005, T-006)
```
