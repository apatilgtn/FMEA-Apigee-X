```

## Implementation Instructions

### Setting Up the Tracking System

1. **Create a new spreadsheet** with the five sheets described above
2. **Set up data validation** for consistent entries:
   - Status: Not Started, In Planning, In Progress, In Review, Completed, Deferred, Cancelled
   - Priority: Critical, High, Medium, Low
   - Categories: Authentication, Security, Traffic Management, etc.

3. **Configure conditional formatting**:
   - Highlight overdue tasks in red
   - Color code priority levels (Critical: Red, High: Orange, Medium: Yellow, Low: Green)
   - Highlight completed tasks in green
   - Shade dependencies that are not yet completed

4. **Set up formulas for automation**:
   - RPN calculation: `=IF(AND(ISNUMBER(F2),ISNUMBER(G2),ISNUMBER(H2)),F2*G2*H2,"")`
   - Days until due: `=IF(ISBLANK(H2),"",H2-TODAY())`
   - Task completion percentage for dashboard
   - Risk reduction calculations

5. **Create pivot tables** for the dashboard to visualize:
   - Tasks by status
   - Tasks by assignee
   - Tasks by priority
   - Tasks by category

### Using the Tracking System

#### Adding New FMEA Items

1. Add the FMEA item to the FMEA Register sheet
2. Assign an ID (e.g., API-001, API-002)
3. Complete all required fields (Process/Function, Failure Mode, Effects, etc.)
4. Calculate the initial RPN
5. Document recommended actions

#### Creating Tasks from FMEA Items

1. For each FMEA item, break down the recommended actions into specific tasks
2. Add each task to the Todo List sheet
3. Assign a unique Task ID (e.g., T-001, T-002)
4. Link to the parent FMEA item using the FMEA ID
5. Categorize the task and assign priority
6. Set due dates and assign responsibility
7. Document any dependencies in the Task Dependencies sheet

#### Updating Task Status

1. Update the Status field as tasks progress
2. Update the % Complete field to reflect progress
3. Add notes about progress, challenges, or changes
4. When a task is completed:
   - Update the Completion Date
   - Add any relevant notes about the implementation
   - Update the parent FMEA item with new S, O, D, and RPN values if applicable

#### Generating Reports

1. The Dashboard sheet automatically updates based on the data in other sheets
2. The Weekly Status Report can be generated by:
   - Updating the date range
   - Filtering the Todo List for items completed in the last week
   - Filtering for items in progress
   - Filtering for upcoming items
   - Adding manual notes from team meetings
