# FMEA Priority Scoring Template for Apigee X API Management

This document provides a comprehensive priority scoring system and templates for Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) in Apigee X API Management. The templates include detailed scoring criteria, calculation methods, and prioritization frameworks to help teams effectively manage and address risks.

## Priority Scoring System

### Risk Priority Number (RPN) Calculation

The standard method for calculating priority in FMEA is the Risk Priority Number (RPN):

```
RPN = Severity (S) × Occurrence (O) × Detection (D)
```

Where:
- **Severity (S)**: Rating of the impact if the failure occurs (1-10)
- **Occurrence (O)**: Rating of the likelihood that the failure will occur (1-10)
- **Detection (D)**: Rating of the ability to detect the failure before impact (1-10)

### Enhanced Priority Scoring for Apigee X

For Apigee X API Management, we recommend an enhanced priority scoring system that considers additional factors relevant to API management:

```
Priority Score = (RPN × Business Impact Factor × Implementation Complexity Factor) / 10
```

Where:
- **Business Impact Factor**: Rating of the business importance (1-5)
- **Implementation Complexity Factor**: Rating of the difficulty to implement remediation (1-5)

This enhanced scoring provides a more nuanced prioritization that accounts for both risk and practical implementation considerations.

## Severity Scoring Criteria for Apigee X

| Rating | Level | Description | Example in Apigee X Context |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1 | Negligible | No noticeable effect on system performance or user experience | Minor formatting issue in API response that doesn't affect functionality |
| 2-3 | Minor | Slight degradation in system performance or minor inconvenience to users | Occasional slight delay in API response time (< 100ms) |
| 4-5 | Moderate | Noticeable impact on system performance or user experience, but workarounds exist | Intermittent API availability issues affecting non-critical functions |
| 6-7 | Significant | Substantial impact on system performance or user experience, limited workarounds | Frequent authentication failures for specific API clients |
| 8 | High | Major system disruption affecting critical functions | Complete failure of rate limiting leading to potential DoS vulnerability |
| 9 | Very High | System failure with security implications | Authentication bypass allowing unauthorized access to protected APIs |
| 10 | Critical | Catastrophic failure with regulatory, legal, or safety implications | Exposure of sensitive PII/PHI data through API responses |

| 3-4 | High | High likelihood of detection before impact | Monitoring alerts detect the issue before significant impact |
| 5-6 | Moderate | Moderate likelihood of detection before impact | Regular manual reviews might detect the issue |
| 7-8 | Low | Low likelihood of detection before impact | Issue might be detected through customer complaints |
| 9 | Very Low | Very low likelihood of detection before impact | Issue would only be detected after significant impact |
| 10 | None | No detection possible before impact | No monitoring or controls in place to detect the issue |

| 4 | Complex | Significant code or architecture changes, extensive testing required | Redesigning authentication flow |
| 5 | Very Complex | Major architectural changes, cross-team coordination, extensive testing | Implementing a new microservices architecture for API backend |

## Priority Classification

Based on the calculated Priority Score, tasks can be classified into priority levels:

| Priority Level | Priority Score Range | Recommended Timeframe | Example Action |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Critical | >400 | Immediate (within 1 week) | Emergency fix deployment |
| High | 200-400 | Short-term (within 1 month) | Prioritize in current sprint |
| Medium | 100-199 | Medium-term (within 3 months) | Schedule in upcoming sprints |
| Low | <100 | Long-term (within 6 months) | Add to backlog |

## Sample Priority Scoring Examples

### Example 1: API Key Validation Failure

```
Failure Mode: API keys not properly validated
Severity (S): 8 (High - Could allow unauthorized access)
Occurrence (O): 4 (Occasional - Has happened in specific endpoints)
Detection (D): 6 (Moderate - Might be detected through logging)
RPN: 8 × 4 × 6 = 192

Business Impact: 4 (High - Affects customer-facing APIs)
Implementation Complexity: 3 (Moderate - Requires policy changes across proxies)

Priority Score: (192 × 4 × 3) / 10 = 230.4
Priority Level: High (Due within 1 month)
```

### Example 2: Rate Limiting Failure

```
Failure Mode: Failure to enforce rate limits
Severity (S): 7 (Significant - Could allow API abuse)
Occurrence (O): 5 (Occasional - Has happened during traffic spikes)
Detection (D): 4 (High - Monitoring would likely detect)
RPN: 7 × 5 × 4 = 140

Business Impact: 3 (Moderate - Affects system performance)
Implementation Complexity: 2 (Low - Configuration change in existing policies)

Priority Score: (140 × 3 × 2) / 10 = 84
Priority Level: Low (Due within 6 months)
```

### Example 3: OAuth Token Validation Failure

```
Failure Mode: OAuth token validation failures
Severity (S): 9 (Very High - Could allow unauthorized access)
Occurrence (O): 3 (Low - Rare but has happened)
Detection (D): 5 (Moderate - Might be detected through monitoring)
RPN: 9 × 3 × 5 = 135

Business Impact: 5 (Critical - Affects all authenticated APIs)
Implementation Complexity: 4 (Complex - Requires significant changes to auth flow)

Priority Score: (135 × 5 × 4) / 10 = 270
Priority Level: High (Due within 1 month)
```

## Priority Scoring Visualization Templates

### Heat Map Template

Create a heat map to visualize the distribution of risks:

```
Severity →
↓ Occurrence | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5-6 | 7-8 | 9-10 |
------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
1-2         | Low | Low | Low | Med | High |
3-4         | Low | Low | Med | High| High |
5-6         | Low | Med | Med | High| Crit |
7-8         | Med | Med | High| Crit| Crit |
9-10        | Med | High| Crit| Crit| Crit |
```

Place each failure mode in the appropriate cell based on its Severity and Occurrence ratings.

### Bubble Chart Template

Create a bubble chart with:
- X-axis: Severity
- Y-axis: Occurrence
- Bubble size: Detection (larger bubbles = harder to detect)
- Bubble color: Priority Level (Red = Critical, Orange = High, Yellow = Medium, Green = Low)

This provides a visual representation of the risk landscape.
